## Session 1 — Project Planning

**Status:** Implementation plan complete. Ready to begin coding.

**Completed:**
- Drafted full `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` covering all 9 milestones (M0–M9) plus appendices.
- Defined tech stack: Python + FastAPI + WebSockets backend, vanilla HTML/JS frontend.
- Clarified all game rules against the reference site (trump ordering, dynamic adjacency, bidding mechanics, scoring thresholds).
- Established architecture principles: shared `GameEngine` with `ModeStrategy` injection, superuser as first-class feature, card-by-card dealing with integrated bidding.
- Added full UX spec: lobby layout, bidding UI (suit buttons), card selection/play flow, no trick history (by design).
- Added game session logging (`.jsonl`), `replay_log.py` debugging script, and tech stack pros/cons.

**Decisions made:**
- Always 4 players, always 2 decks (108 cards). No variable player count.
- Cards dealt one at a time with `asyncio.sleep(DEAL_DELAY_SECONDS)`. No deal-all-at-once simplification.
- Bidding is suit-based (click a suit button), not card-selection. Server validates card availability.
- Disconnect behavior: all players kicked, room destroyed. No reconnect (see Future Todos).
- No trick history in UI — players must count cards from memory.
- Game master must explicitly select Upgrade or Find Friends before game can start.
- Superuser mode restricted to game master only; requires explicit confirmation button click.

**Next steps (first PR):**
- M0: Create project skeleton, `pyproject.toml`, directory layout.
- M1: Implement `Card`, `Deck` models with tests.
- M2: Implement `TrumpContext`, `classify_play`, `find_tractors` with tests.
